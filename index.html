                  <p> My name is Keren Cerezo and I am originally from Texas. I moved to Charlotte back in 2012 and absolutely love it here. 
                      I love that the mountains and the beach are only a few hours apart. I grew up in a very small town so Charlotte is just the right size for me- not to big and not to small.</p>
                    
                  <p> I work as a legal assistant for The Odom Firm located right outside of Uptown. Our areas of practice are: Condemnation, Eminent Domain, Zoning, Personal Injury  and Dissability.
                      I am the legal assistant to all four attorneys; all who practice different areas. For more information about The Odom Firm, please visit <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">www.mecklaw.com.</a></p>

                  <p> Being an administrator for 10 years it has taught me how to manage my time, work well with others, follow task, meet deadlines, work under pressure and so much more. However, I am now looking
                      to change in my career and become a web developer. </p>
                      
                  <p>In my spear time, I enjoy working out, camping, dancing, spending time with my fianc√© and our great dane, Xena.</p>
